YOLK aims to restore this distressed family unit by encouraging open communication. It will minimise confrontation in initiating discussion following conflict and it will aid conversation between parent and child by quantifying positive, neutral and negative emotions in tactile and visual responses to develop empathy and self-awareness.</p><br/><p>Used in one on one interactions, YOLK will allow each individual to become aware their own emotions; it will identify overwhelming instances; and encourage self reflection and emotion control. In providing a platform for open discussion a supportive relationship will be formed and the adolescent&rsquo;s resilience and autonomy improved. YOLK guides its users to speak and think assertively helping the articulation of their emotions and the development of empathy skills.</p>",

Whilst it is understood and accepted that we have little control over our privacy in public spaces, our privacy at home is an expected necessity. In recent years, shared living has become a global phenomenon that has created a strong trend in the major cities of Australia, with at least 722,000 people residing in shared housing and student accommodation. Reduced levels of privacy is an inevitable part of living in a shared environment and there is a strong absence of products designed for this problem. Shellta is an affordable product that offers customisable privacy solutions for people living in shared environments. Shellta aims at replicating elements of privacy achieved in one’s own home, a comfort which is inevitably lost in shared living.",
