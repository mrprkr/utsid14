With the rise of both sustainably-minded consumers and the want for personalised products, <em>Re-Do</em> allows consumers to log on to a website where they will have the ability to choose set bagwear patterns and then allocate materials to each section, in turn creating one-of-a-kind customisable bags. The materials that the system provides to consumers are strictly off-cuts and unused materials - leathers, plastics, fabrics -&nbsp; from companies where the materials, through the concept of upcycling are given new value and new life in the form of a personalised bag.</p><p><br/><a href='http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f234/sammybic/bagsinline_zps41fd049a.jpg' target='_blank'><img src='http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f234/sammybic/bagsinline_zps41fd049a.jpg' /></a></p><p>The Re-Do system provides an intuitive interface that guides the user through designing their own bags. The interface combines clean, but striking graphic design and a free-flowing system path that allows the use of the system to be incredibly easy to navigate and understand while presenting an interactive experience with the user. Some of the pages include a &quot;Choose a Pattern&quot; page, a &quot;Customise&quot; page and a &quot;Materials&quot; page with each page taking the user through a different engaging experience.</p><br/><p><a href='http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f234/sammybic/interfaces-together_zpsecaf373a.jpg' target='_blank'><img src='http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f234/sammybic/interfaces-together_zpsecaf373a.jpg'/></a></p>",
